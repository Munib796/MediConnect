# MediConnect

An Assistant Based full-stack hospital and doctor appointment booking platform built for the Pakistani market. MediConnect connects patients with doctors across multiple hospitals, with dedicated portals for patients, doctors, and administrators.

## Features

### Patient Portal

- Search doctors by city and specialization across Pakistan
- Browse hospitals and see doctors affiliated with each location
- Book appointments (cash or online payment via Stripe)
- **Token-based queue system** — real-time queue tracker shows your position with no guessing
- View appointment history and leave reviews for completed visits
- Email confirmations for bookings
- Accessible, mobile-first design with smooth animations and keyboard navigation

### Doctor Portal
- Apply to hospitals with fee, schedule, and capacity details (document upload required)
- Track application status (pending / approved / rejected) with real-time updates
- Toggle availability at approved hospitals
- View and manage appointments with token numbers
- Mark appointments complete (only once payment is received)
- Profile management with photo upload via Cloudinary
- Dedicated dark-themed professional interface

### Admin Portal
- **Polished dashboard** with at-a-glance platform stats and action items
- Manage cities, specializations, and hospitals (with image upload)
- Review and approve/reject doctor-hospital affiliation applications
- Oversee all appointments platform-wide (mark cash payments as paid, remove bookings)
- Accessible CRUD operations with confirmation dialogs and keyboard support

All three portals are strictly role-separated — a user logged into one cannot access the other two until they log out. Each portal has a context-aware footer tailored to its audience.
